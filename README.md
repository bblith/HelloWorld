## Notes

I encountered several obstacles with this application: initially, I did not have any issues with the Toast statement. After I stepped away from my project over the weekend, I returned to find the Toast statement no longer visible when I clicked the button on the emulator. Also, while typing in the commands in the terminal, I was prompted to authenticate using my GitHub credentials, but I was met with an error saying that terminal authentication was removed in 2021 so I could not push the walkthrough gif through command line--rather, I had to manually upload the gif through GitHub. 

I followed the prework tutorials attentively, however I still encountered these issues. I tried troubleshooting the best I could, but I still could not get the Toast message to appear on the emulator.
